This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

run `npm install`

run `npm run dev` to launch the development server

open a browser to http://localhost:3000 to view changes as you make them

## Deploying the application

This application serves static pages. It was built with Firebase as the hosting service.

To deploy run `npm run export` and `firebase deploy`. If firebase is not configured, run `firebase init`, choose the "hosting" option only, then select `out` as the public directory.

### Checking the Deployment

After the application is deployed, you should be able to verify the live version [here](https://aconyte-arcade.web.app/).
